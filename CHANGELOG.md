# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-01-12

### Changed

- `cc-mirror update` now resets `npm/` and `tweakcc/` before reinstalling, preserving config/tasks/skills for a clean rebuild.
- Update command defaults to quiet tweakcc output; use `--verbose` to show full logs.

### Added

- Update rebuild step test coverage, plus a gated live E2E update smoke test for headless CLI runs.

### Fixed

- Update no longer reuses stale tweakcc prompt data that could corrupt the CLI after upgrades.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Task command coverage for `tasks show`, `tasks update`, and `tasks clean` (JSON output + filters).

### Changed

- Test runner defaults to serial execution (unless `--test-concurrency` is provided) to reduce flaky Ink/TUI runs.
- E2E flows now use real npm installs; update tests verify `variant.json` timestamps and settings-only updates preserve the CLI.
- TUI tests wait for async updates to complete before assertions.
- Core flow tests now assert the installed npm package version after create/update.

### Documentation

- Windows PATH guidance for wrapper scripts added to user-facing docs.

### Fixed

- Windows npm installs run via the shell to execute `npm.cmd`, with validated/quoted inputs to avoid unsafe command parsing.
- Variant creation rejects invalid names that could break wrapper scripts.
