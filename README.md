# claude-sneakpeek

Get a parallel build of Claude Code that unlocks feature-flagged capabilities like swarm mode.

Demo video of swarm mode in action: https://x.com/NicerInPerson/status/2014989679796347375

This installs a completely isolated instance of Claude Code—separate config, sessions, MCP servers, and credentials. Your existing Claude Code installation is untouched.

## Install

```bash
npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek quick --name claudesp
```

Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH if not already (macOS/Linux):

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Then run `claudesp` to launch.

## What gets unlocked?

Features that are built into Claude Code but not yet publicly released:

- **Swarm mode** — Native multi-agent orchestration with `TeammateTool`
- **Delegate mode** — Task tool can spawn background agents
- **Team coordination** — Teammate messaging and task ownership

## Commands

```bash
npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek quick --name claudesp   # Install
npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek update claudesp         # Update
npx @realmikekelly/claude-sneakpeek remove claudesp         # Uninstall
```

## Versioned Variants

Run multiple Claude Code versions side-by-side with versioned variants:

```bash
# Create versioned variant (from source)
./scripts/create-versioned-variant.sh 22    # Creates claudesp22

# Update preview alias
./scripts/update-preview-alias.sh claudesp22
```

This gives you:
- `claudesp20` — stable, tested version
- `claudesp22` — latest for testing
- `preview` alias — points to latest

See [docs/guides/version-upgrade.md](docs/guides/version-upgrade.md) for details.
